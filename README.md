### Hi there 👋


You reach out to my Github!! It is not at all organized, some of the repos have unsolicieted code files which I just wanted to store somewhere. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on computational economics and I use Julia mostly for that. 
- 💬 Feel free to reach me through email: [aruecon@gmail.com](mailto:aruecon@gmail.com) :handshake:
- :octocat: Encrypted emails at: [arubhardwaj@tuta.io](mailto:arubhardwaj@tuta.io)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I do nerdy stuff!! Aah, I am not fun at all :blush:
