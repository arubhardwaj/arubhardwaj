### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my Github!! It is not at all organized: some repos have unsolicieted code files which I just wanted to store somewhere (well!!!). 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in Julia and focusing on computational methods used in economics.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach me through email: [arubhardwaj@tuta.io](mailto:arubhardwaj@tuta.io) :octocat: :handshake:
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I do nerdy stuff!! Aah, I am not fun at all :blush:
