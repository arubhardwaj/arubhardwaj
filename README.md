### Hi there 👋


Welcome to my Github!! It is not at all organized: some repos have unsolicieted code files which I just wanted to store somewhere (well!!!). 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on computational economics and I use Julia mostly for that. 
- 💬 Feel free to reach me through email: [arubhardwaj@tuta.io](mailto:arubhardwaj@tuta.io) :octocat: :handshake:
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I do nerdy stuff!! Aah, I am not fun at all :blush:  

<!--
**arubhardwaj/arubhardwaj** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
