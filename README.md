### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**arubhardwaj/arubhardwaj** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

You reach out to my Github!! It is not at all organized, some of the repos have unsolicieted code files which I just wanted to store somewhere. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on computational economics and I use Julia mostly for that. 
- ğŸ’¬ Feel free to reach me through email: [aruecon@gmail.com](mailto:aruecon@gmail.com) :handshake:
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I do nerdy stuff!! Aah, I am not fun at all :blush:
